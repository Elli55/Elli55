# 👋 I'm Elli, somewhere between business and data, always learning.

I come from the world of **management**,  
where strategies often sound nice but are hard to measure.  
That’s why I wanted to understand **what makes good decisions really work.**  
That’s how I found data, not just because I love numbers,  
but because I want to know **how they help people make smarter choices.**

📊 **What I’m learning now**

not to become a data scientist,  
but to make **better business decisions based on data.**
